About
=====

A simple test Android app to play with different Payment SDKs and APIs. Setup for Android studio using gradle builds.

Description
===========

Currently only two vendors are integrated. 

* Stripe
* Mastercard via Simplify SDK

Stripe's official SDK only supports generating a token on Android today. Added charging the card functionality as well from their server SDK.
